    <h1>Welcome to my Jira page</h1>
    <h2>My Jira badge is posted</h2>
    <p>Jira is solid, as a long term tech I approve</p>
    <p>Studying Confluence fundamentals, badge coming soon</p>
    <p>In the Confluence self-study course, Students are asked to look at how their company uses Confluence</p>
    <p>We used Microsoft Teams at my last company so I used That as the business case example while training in Confluence</p>
    <p>It found many reasons to use conluence based on that example. Share knowledge, Project colaboration, Employee engagement</p>
    <p> A confluence space is a collection of related pages</p>
